# Find First and Last Occurrence of an Element in a String

This Java program finds the first and last occurrence of a specified element in a given string.

## Description

The `Recursion_Intermediate2.java` program implements a recursive approach to find the first and last occurrence of a specified element in a given string. It recursively traverses the string, checking each character, and updates the `first` and `last` variables to store the indices of the first and last occurrences of the specified element, respectively.

## Example

For example, given the string `"abaacdsafaah"` and the element `'a'`, the program will output:
```
First Occurrence: 1
Last Occurrence: 10
```
